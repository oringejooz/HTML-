XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language
XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML
XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application
XHTML is supported by all major browsers

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) are both languages used to create web pages, but they have some key differences in syntax and rules. Hereâ€™s a comparison along with examples:

### 1. Syntax Rules
#### HTML:
- **Less Strict**: HTML is more forgiving with syntax errors. Browsers can interpret HTML even if there are mistakes.
- **Case Insensitivity**: HTML tags and attributes are not case-sensitive.
- **Optional Closing Tags**: Some tags in HTML can be left open, and browsers will close them automatically.

#### XHTML:
- **More Strict**: XHTML is stricter with syntax. It must be well-formed XML.
- **Case Sensitivity**: XHTML tags and attributes must be in lowercase.
- **Mandatory Closing Tags**: All tags must be properly closed, either with a closing tag or self-closed.

### 2. Document Structure
#### HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>HTML Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML is forgiving with syntax errors.</p>
    <br> <!-- Optional closing -->
</body>
</html>
```

#### XHTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
<head>
    <title>XHTML Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is XHTML</h1>
    <p>XHTML requires stricter syntax.</p>
    <br /> <!-- Mandatory self-closing -->
</body>
</html>
```

### 3. Tag and Attribute Rules
#### HTML:
- Attributes can have values without quotes.
- Attribute minimization is allowed (e.g., `checked` for checkboxes).

```html
<input type=checkbox checked>
```

#### XHTML:
- Attribute values must be in quotes.
- Attribute minimization is not allowed; all attributes must have values.

```html
<input type="checkbox" checked="checked" />
```

### 4. Namespaces
- **HTML**: HTML does not use XML namespaces.
- **XHTML**: XHTML uses XML namespaces and requires a namespace declaration in the `<html>` tag.

### 5. MIME Type
- **HTML**: Usually served as `text/html`.
- **XHTML**: Can be served as `application/xhtml+xml` or `text/html`. Serving as `application/xhtml+xml` ensures stricter parsing by the browser.

### 6. Compatibility
- **HTML**: Widely supported by all browsers with great flexibility.
- **XHTML**: Browsers need to be compliant with XML rules, and older browsers might not fully support `application/xhtml+xml`.

### Summary
- **HTML**: More lenient, easier to write and debug for beginners.
- **XHTML**: Stricter, enforces better coding practices, and ensures document well-formedness, making it compatible with XML tools and standards.

Choosing between HTML and XHTML depends on the needs of the project. If strict adherence to XML standards and better interoperability with XML tools are important, XHTML might be the better choice. For general web development with wide compatibility and easier syntax, HTML is often preferred.
